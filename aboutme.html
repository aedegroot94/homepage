            <h2>About this website</h2>
            <p>I wrote this website as a fun programming challenge, and to build a portfolio to show off past and future code projects. I decided to include a music section because I'm a passionate amateur musician and I will never pass up a chance to talk about this part of my life.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
				My name is Anne. I was born in Germany in 1994. The year after I was born my parents moved to Eerbeek in the Netherlands, the home town of my mother and the town I would grow up in. Currently I live in Apeldoorn with my boyfriend Tom, our cat Poppy and our two (soon to be four!) rats, Luna and Leia.
				<br><br>
				I currently work as a cloud engineer at <a href="https://www.universal.nl/">Universal IT</a> in Arnhem, a city near my home town. I started off as a support engineer but I currently spend my days working on internal projects: I come up with and implement solutions to make life easier for my coworkers, or I do things that need to happen but no one has found the time for yet.
				<br><br>
				When I'm not working I spend a lot of time on my big passion: Music. I am an amateur horn player and I currently play in two fanfare orchestras. More about what I do and how this came to be can be found on the <a href="music.html">page</a> I dedicated to this subject.

            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <p>
				<ul>
					<li>I played the trombone for a few years. It didn't work out..</li>
					<li>Before deciding on computer science, I wanted to be a teacher.</li>
					<li>If I were a boy, I'd be called Thomas. That's my boyfriends name!</li>
					<li>I will believe anything anyone tells me. When we picked up our cat at the shelter, she went into the carrier as soon as we put it down. I was told they trained them to do that. I didn't question it.</li>
					<li>I'm not very good at coming up with fun facts. Know me better than myself? Leave your suggestions <a href="contact.html">here</a>!</li>
