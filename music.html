						<h2>My musical story</h2>
						<p>
						When I grew up, both of my parents played in the local fanfare orchestra, <a href="http://www.eendracht-eerbeek.nl">Eendracht Eerbeek</a>. My mom played the flugelhorn and my dad played the trombone. The orchestra was (and still is) a very tight knit group of people, so me and my younger brother were often found at parties, concerts and youth activities. When I was 5 or 6 years old, I started playing the recorder, like most young kids used to before picking a more permanent instrument. When I was eight, I was ready to start playing a larger instrument and I chose the horn because one of my friends played it. I wasn't really sure what a horn was but I didn't want to play the same instrument as my parents, anyway. A few weeks later there was a horn in my bedroom, and I started my first horn lessons.
						<br><br>
						I always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with my horn. I didn't find horn parts very fun, I didn't like practicing very much, lessons were boring and I wasn't very good at it. At one point I decided to switch to trombone, an instrument that I had wanted to play for a long time, but I had a hard time having to start over again. After 2 years of inconsistent lessons and very little progress, I almost quit music altogether - until my mom offered that I could go back to horn, which I did.
						<br><br>
						After switching back to the horn, my passion for music slowly started to grow. I joined the 'big orchestra', I started getting better and 'moving up the ranks'. A few years ago, I decided to take up lessons again, and this time it really changed something for me. I started being a lot more active musically - I joined project orchestra's whenever I could, kept going to my lessons, started practicing consistently, and eventually I even auditioned for <a href="http://www.geldersfanfareorkest.nl/">GFO</a> (an ambitious regional orchestra), where I'm currently trying out.
						<br><br>
						My current goal is to keep improving and keep growing as a musician, and to stay as musically active as I can.
