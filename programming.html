						<h2>About this page</h2>
						<p>I started studying computer science at <a href="https://www.han.nl/international/english/">HAN university of applied sciences</a> in 2014. I graduated my first year with honors and was good at what I did. I got high grades, liked to take the extra step on assignments, and was asked to be a student assistant in my third year. Unfortunately, I had to quit my studies early due to health reasons. However, this has not stopped me from persuing a career in computer science. I currently work for a company providing cloud services. In my spare time I take on programming challenges/projects for fun and to learn. I also try to take on as many SQL and coding tasks as I can at work, because in the end, that's why I chose computer science and what I would like to do long term. In the future I will use this page to showcase some of the things I've created.</p>
